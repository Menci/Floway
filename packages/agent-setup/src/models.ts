// Editor model projections. Zed's `anthropic_compatible` provider and VS Code's
// `customendpoint` vendor both take a snapshot of the catalog at setup time —
// neither can discover models at runtime — so the gateway projects the catalog
// once here and embeds the result in the script it serves.
//
// This is deliberately the only implementation. It previously existed three
// times over: a jq program, a PowerShell loop, and a dashboard preview builder,
// which had to agree byte for byte and repeatedly did not — a stated limit of
// `0` became a fallback under PowerShell truthiness, an empty effort list was
// dropped, and key order drifted. One projection cannot disagree with itself.
//
// Two values are deliberately absent from what this produces. The endpoint URL
// is not here because the gateway never renders its own public origin — the
// dashboard injects it into the executing shell, and the installer's merge
// supplies it. The API key is not here because it already appears once in the
// script, and copying it into every model entry would multiply the credential
// through a file for no gain. The installer's merge supplies both.

// deserialization and takes the whole provider down, so this number is ours.
